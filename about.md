I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.princeton.edu) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu), advised by [Prof. Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/). My research interests include language, games, representation learning, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence in general.

I was an undergrad in [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and an intern in MIT [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu)/[BCS](https://bcs.mit.edu) and [Google Research](https://research.google).
