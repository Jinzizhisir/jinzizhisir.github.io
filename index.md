I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/). I was an undergrad in Yao Class at Tsinghua University, and an intern in MIT CSAIL/BCS and Google Research.

My research interests include language, games, representation learning, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence in general.

My personal interests include reading, basketball, travel, and rap.
