I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/). Previously, I graduated from Yao Class at Tsinghua University.

My research interests include language, games, representation learning, cognitive science, and AI in general.

My personal interests include reading, basketball, travel, and rap.
