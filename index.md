I am a third-year Ph.D. student in computer science at Princeton University, advised by [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/). Previously, I graduated from Yao Class at Tsinghua University.

<!-- My research interests include language, reinforcement, representation learning and their interplays, e.g. enabling language models to act in interactive games [EMNLP'20], or game agents to evolve communications resembling language [ICLR'22 (1)]. 
The vision is to connect general-purpose representations (language) and general-purpose task-solving (RL), for challenging problems requiring semantic [NAACL'21] inductive bias plus flexible adaption and exploration [ICLR'22 (2)].

My research interests include language, reinforcement, representation learning and their interplays, e.g. enabling [language models to act in interactive games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02903) or [game agents to evolve communications resembling language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13344). 
The vision is to connect general-purpose representations (language) and general-purpose task-solving (RL), for challenging problems requiring [semantic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13552) inductive bias plus flexible adaption and [exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01251).


<!-- The goal is twofold: to leverage language priors for grounded and interactive tasks, and to leverage such domains for more functional and  langauge modeling. -->

My personal interests include reading, basketball, pool, travel, and rap.
